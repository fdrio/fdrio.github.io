* Introduction
This document covers basic calculus concepts, including derivatives and integrals.

* Definitions
** Derivative
The derivative of a function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \]

** Integral
The integral of a function \( f(x) \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is given by:
\[ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \]

* Theorems
** Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
If \( f(x) \) is continuous on \( [a, b] \), then:
\[ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a) \]
where \( F(x) \) is the antiderivative of \( f(x) \).

* Examples
** Example 1: Derivative
Find the derivative of \( f(x) = x^2 \):
\[ f'(x) = 2x \]

** Example 2: Integral
Evaluate \( \int_0^2 x^2 \, dx \):
\[
\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^2 = \frac{8}{3}.
\]

* Exercises
** Exercise 1: Compute a Derivative
Find \( f'(x) \) for \( f(x) = \sin(x) \).

** Exercise 2: Compute an Integral
Evaluate \( \int_0^\pi \sin(x) \, dx \).
