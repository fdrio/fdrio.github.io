Hi there ðŸ‘‹,


I'm a software engineer with experience in backend development and search systems. My experience spans cloud infrastructure, data engineering, and search algorithms, where I help create impactful systems that enhance information retrieval and user experiences. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy exploring new technologies. When I'm not programming, you will find me diving into mathematical and computer science topics, or immersed in classical history.
